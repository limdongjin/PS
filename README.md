# Problem Solving

- Problem Solving with algorithms and data structures
- Implement algorithms and data structures
- Test based.

## Programming Language

- c++
- java
- python

## Library/Statement for Test

- c++ : using assert ( 'cassert' or 'assert.h' header )
- java : using junit
- python : using assert

Java specifically uses junit to improve the proficiency of junit.

In Python or c ++, 
I only test with assert because i have considered a coding interview environment 
that is restricted from using the library.
